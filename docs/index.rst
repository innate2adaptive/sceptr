SCEPTR: A fast and performant TCR representation model
======================================================

SCEPTR (Simple Contrastive Embedding of the Primary sequence of T cell Receptors) is a BERT-like attention model trained on T cell receptor (TCR) data.
It maps TCRs to vector representations, which enables alignment-free downstream TCR and TCR repertoire analysis such as TCR clustering or classification.
