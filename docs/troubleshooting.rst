Installing on Python 3.13 on Windows
------------------------------------

While in general SCEPTR is supported up to the latest versions of Python, CI testing has suggested that there may be potential issues using SCEPTR on Python >= 3.13 on Windows.
If Windows users run into any issues, please submit an issue on the repository to notify the maintainers, and for now please try using Python 3.12 instead.
